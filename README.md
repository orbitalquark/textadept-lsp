# Language Server Protocol

A client for Textadept that communicates over the [Language Server Protocol][] (LSP) with
language servers in order to provide autocompletion, calltips, go to definition, and more.
It implements version 3.16.0 of the protocol, but does not support all protocol features. The
[`Server.new()`](#Server.new) function contains the client's current set of capabilities.

Install this module by copying it into your *~/.textadept/modules/* directory or Textadept's
*modules/* directory, and then putting the following in your *~/.textadept/init.lua*:

    local lsp = require('lsp')

Next, configure the languages you want to have LSP support for. For example, to set up Lua support:

    lsp.server_commands.lua = 'lua-lsp'

See [below](#language-specific-configuration) for information on how to set up other languages.

When recognized source code files are opened, their associated language servers are automatically
started (one per language, though). Note that language servers typically require a root URI,
so this module uses `io.get_project_root()` for this. If the file being opened is not part
of a project recognized by Textadept, the language server will not be started.

Language Server features are available from the Tools > Language Server menu. Note that not
all language servers may support the menu options. You can assign key bindings for these
features, such as:

    keys['ctrl+alt+ '] = function() textadept.editing.autocomplete('lsp') end
    keys['ctrl+H'] = lsp.signature_help
    keys.f12 = lsp.goto_definition

**Note:** If you want to inspect the LSP messages sent back and forth, you can use the Lua
command entry to set `require('lsp').log_rpc = true`. It doesn't matter if any LSPs are
already active -- from this point forward all messages will be logged to the "[LSP]" buffer.

**Warning:** Buggy language servers that do not respect the protocol may cause this module
and Textadept to hang, waiting for a response. There is no recourse other than to force-quit
Textadept and restart.

<a id="events.LSP_NOTIFICATION"></a>
### `events.LSP_NOTIFICATION` (string)

Emitted when an LSP server emits an unhandled notification.
  This is useful for handling server-specific notifications. Responses can be sent via
  [`Server:respond()`](#Server.respond).
  An event handler should return `true`.
  Arguments:

  * _`lang`_: The lexer name of the LSP language.
  * _`server`_: The LSP server.

<a id="textadept.editing.autocompleters.lsp"></a>
### `textadept.editing.autocompleters.lsp` (function)

Autocompleter function for a language server.

<a id="lsp.log_rpc"></a>
### `lsp.log_rpc` (bool)

<a id="lsp.show_all_diagnostics"></a>
### `lsp.show_all_diagnostics` (bool)

Whether or not to show all diagnostics if `show_diagnostics` is `true`.
  The default value is `false`, and assumes any diagnostics on the current line or next line
  are due to an incomplete statement during something like an autocompletion, signature help,
  etc. request.

<a id="lsp.show_diagnostics"></a>
### `lsp.show_diagnostics` (bool)

Whether or not to show diagnostics.
  The default value is `true`, and shows them as annotations.

Helper function for processing a single message from the Language Server's notification stream.
Cache any incoming messages (particularly responses) that happen to be picked up.

Parameters:

* *`data`*: String message from the Language Server.

<a id="Server:handle_notification"></a>

Handles an unsolicited notification from this language server.

Parameters:

* *`method`*: String method name of the notification.
* *`params`*: Table of parameters for the notification.

<a id="Server:handle_stdout"></a>
### `Server:handle_stdout`(*output*)

Processes unsolicited, incoming stdout from the Language Server, primarily to look for
notifications and act on them.

Parameters:

* *`output`*: String stdout from the Language Server.

<a id="Server:log"></a>
### `Server:log`(*message*)

Silently logs the given message.

Parameters:

* *`message`*: String message to log.

<a id="Server:notify"></a>
### `Server:notify`(*method, params*)
