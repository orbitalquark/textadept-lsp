--- @module package

--- Loads the given module. The function starts by looking into the `package.loaded` table to
-- determine whether `modname` is already loaded. If it is, then `require` returns the value
-- stored at `package.loaded[modname]`. (The absence of a second result in this case signals
-- that this call did not have to load the module.) Otherwise, it tries to find a *loader*
-- for the module.
--
-- To find a loader, `require` is guided by the table `package.searchers`. Each item in this
-- table is a search function, that searches for the module in a particular way. By changing
-- this table, we can change how `require` looks for a module. The following explanation is
-- based on the default configuration for `package.searchers`.
--
-- First `require` queries `package.preload[modname]`. If it has a value, this value (which must be
-- a function) is the loader. Otherwise `require` searches for a Lua loader using the path stored
-- in `package.path`. If that also fails, it searches for a C loader using the path stored in
-- `package.cpath`. If that also fails, it tries an *all-in-one* loader (see `package.searchers`).
--
-- Once a loader is found, `require` calls the loader with two arguments: `modname` and an
-- extra value, a *loader data*, also returned by the searcher. The loader data can be any
-- value useful to the module; for the default searchers, it indicates where the loader
-- was found. (For instance, if the loader came from a file, this extra value is the file
-- path.) If the loader returns any non-nil value, `require` assigns the returned value to
-- `package.loaded[modname]`. If the loader does not return a non-nil value and has not assigned
-- any value to `package.loaded[modname]`, then `require` assigns true to this entry. In any
-- case, `require` returns the final value of `package.loaded[modname]`. Besides that value,
-- `require` also returns as a second result the loader data returned by the searcher, which
-- indicates how `require` found the module.
--
-- If there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find any loader for
-- the module, then `require` raises an error.
-- @param modname
-- @function _G.require

--- A string describing some compile-time configurations for packages. This string is a sequence
-- of lines:
--
--   - The first line is the directory separator string. Default is '`\`' for Windows and '`/`'
--     for all other systems.
--   - The second line is the character that separates templates in a path. Default is '`;`'.
--   - The third line is the string that marks the substitution points in a template. Default is
--     '`?`'.
--   - The fourth line is a string that, in a path in Windows, is replaced by the executable's
--     directory. Default is '`!`'.
--   - The fifth line is a mark to ignore all text after it when building the `luaopen_`
--     function name. Default is '`-`'.

-- @field config

--- A string with the path used by `require` to search for a C loader.
--
-- Lua initializes the C path `package.cpath` in the same way it initializes the Lua path
-- `package.path`, using the environment variable `LUA_CPATH_5_4` or the environment variable
-- `LUA_CPATH` or a default path defined in `luaconf.h`.
-- @field cpath

--- A table used by `require` to control which modules are already loaded. When you require a
-- module `modname` and `package.loaded[modname]` is not false, `require` simply returns the
-- value stored there.
--
-- This variable is only a reference to the real table; assignments to this variable do not
-- change the table used by `require`. The real table is stored in the C registry (see §4.3),
-- indexed by the key `LUA_LOADED_TABLE`, a string.
-- @table loaded

--- See `package.searchers`.
--
-- Deprecated in Lua 5.2.
-- @table loaders

--- A string with the path used by `require` to search for a Lua loader.
--
-- At start-up, Lua initializes this variable with the value of the environment variable
-- `LUA_PATH_5_4` or the environment variable `LUA_PATH` or with a default path defined in
-- `luaconf.h`, if those environment variables are not defined. A "`;;`" in the value of the
-- environment variable is replaced by the default path.
-- @field path

--- A table to store loaders for specific modules (see `require`).
--
-- This variable is only a reference to the real table; assignments to this variable do not
-- change the table used by `require`. The real table is stored in the C registry (see §4.3),
-- indexed by the key `LUA_LOADED_TABLE`, a string.
-- @table preload

--- A table used by `require` to control how to find modules.
--
-- Each entry in this table is a *searcher function*. When looking for a module, `require`
-- calls each of these searchers in ascending order, with the module name (the argument given
-- to `require`) as its sole argument. If the searcher finds the module, it returns another
-- function, the module *loader*, plus an extra value, a *loader data*, that will be passed
-- to that loader and returned as a second result by `require`. If it cannot find the module,
-- it returns a string explaining why (or nil if it has nothing to say).
--
-- Lua initializes this table with four functions.
--
-- The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the `package.preload` table.
--
-- The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path stored at
-- `package.path`. The search is done as described in function `package.searchpath`.
--
-- The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given by the variable
-- `package.cpath`. Again, the search is done as described in function `package.searchpath`. For
-- instance, if the C path is the string
--
--   "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so"
--
-- the searcher for module `foo` will try to open the files `./foo.so`, `./foo.dll`, and
-- `/usr/local/foo/init.so`, in that order. Once it finds a C library, this searcher first uses
-- a dynamic link facility to link the application with the library. Then it tries to find a
-- C function inside the library to be used as the loader. The name of this C function is the
-- string "`luaopen_`" concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced
-- by an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its suffix after (and including)
-- the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the module name is `a.b.c-v2.1 `, the function
-- name will be `luaopen_a_b_c`.
--
-- The fourth searcher tries an *all-in-one loader*. It searches the C path for a library for
-- the root name of the given module. For instance, when requiring `a.b.c`, it will search for
-- a C library for `a`. If found, it looks into it for an open function for the submodule; in
-- our example, that would be `luaopen_a_b_c`. With this facility, a package can pack several
-- C submodules into one single library, with each submodule keeping its original open function.
--
-- All searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value the file path where
-- the module was found, as returned by `package.searchpath`. The first searcher always returns
-- the string "`:preload:`".
--
-- Searchers should raise no errors and have no side effects in Lua. (They may have side effects
-- in C, for instance by linking the application with a library.)
--
-- New in Lua 5.2.
-- @table searchers

--- Dynamically links the host program with the C library `libname`.
--
-- If `funcname` is "`*`", then it only links with the library, making the symbols exported
-- by the library available to other dynamically linked libraries. Otherwise, it looks for
-- a function `funcname` inside the library and returns this function as a C function. So,
-- `funcname` must follow the `lua_CFunction` prototype (see `lua_CFunction`).
--
-- This is a low-level function. It completely bypasses the package and module system. Unlike
-- `require`, it does not perform any path searching and does not automatically adds
-- extensions. `libname` must be the complete file name of the C library, including if necessary
-- a path and an extension. `funcname` must be the exact name exported by the C library (which
-- may depend on the C compiler and linker used).
--
-- This functionality is not supported by ISO C. As such, it is only available on some platforms
-- (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, BSD, plus other Unix systems that support the `dlfcn`
-- standard).
--
-- This function is inherently insecure, as it allows Lua to call any function in any readable
-- dynamic library in the system. (Lua calls any function assuming the function has a proper
-- prototype and respects a proper protocol (see lua_CFunction). Therefore, calling an arbitrary
-- function in an arbitrary dynamic library more often than not results in an access violation.)
-- @param libname
-- @param funcname
-- @function package.loadlib

--- Searches for the given `name` in the given `path`.
--
-- A path is a string containing a sequence of _templates_ separated by semicolons. For each
-- template, the function replaces each interrogation mark (if any) in the template with a copy
-- of `name` wherein all occurrences of `sep` (a dot, by default) were replaced by `rep` (the
-- system's directory separator, by default), and then tries to open the resulting file name.
-- For instance, if the path is the string
--
--   "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua"
--
-- the search for the name `foo.a` will try to open the files `./foo/a.lua`, `./foo/a.lc`, and
-- `/usr/local/foo/a/init.lua`, in that order.
--
-- Returns the resulting name of the first file that it can open in read mode (after closing
-- the file), or nil plus an error message if none succeeds. (This error message lists all file
-- names it tried to open.)
